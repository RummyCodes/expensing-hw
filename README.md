# Approach Overview  

## Technologies Used:  
- **Playwright**  
- **TypeScript**  

My approach includes **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration, ensuring that tests are executed automatically.

# 📝 Detailed cheklist: 
## Task 2: 
Android: Add error message for character limit for purpose field

### Character Counter Display
```
✅ Ensure that the character counter appears when the user types the 500th character.
✅ Verify that the character counter updates dynamically as the user types.
```

### Character Limit Handling (1,000 Characters)
```
✅ Confirm that the user can continue typing beyond 1,000 characters.
✅ Validate that an error state is triggered when the text exceeds 1,000 characters.
✅ Ensure the field remains editable even after exceeding 1,000 characters.
✅ Check that the error state is removed once the text is reduced to 1,000 characters or below.
```

### Error State & CTA Behavior
```
✅ Verify that the field turns red when exceeding 1,000 characters.
✅ Confirm that the CTA (Save/Submit) is disabled when the character count exceeds 1,000.
✅ Ensure the CTA becomes active again when the character count is reduced to 1,000 or below.
✅ Test that error styling disappears (not red) once the character count is within the allowed limit.
```

### Suggestions Behavior
```
✅ Ensure that text suggestions (e.g., autocomplete, predictive text) are displayed while typing up to 100 characters.
✅ Verify that suggestions are no longer displayed once the text surpasses 100 characters.
```

## Task 3: 
iOS: Strong password policy

### Old Password Input
```
✅ Ensure the old password field is present and required before submitting.
✅ Verify that the old password is validated only after clicking the CTA.
✅ Confirm that if the old password is incorrect, an error message is displayed as per the design.
✅ Ensure that after an incorrect old password attempt, the user can retry without refreshing the page.
```
### New Password Validation
```
✅ Verify that the new password field is present and required.
✅ Check that entering fewer than 8 characters triggers a validation error.
✅ Confirm that a new password with no numerical characters triggers an error.
✅ Ensure that a new password with no letters triggers an error.
✅ Validate that the password is accepted when it meets all criteria:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains at least one numerical character
- Contains at least one letter
```
### CTA (Submit Button) Behavior
```
✅ Ensure the CTA remains disabled until:
- The old password is entered.
- The new password meets all validation criteria.
✅ Verify that the CTA becomes active once both conditions are met.
✅ Confirm that clicking the CTA triggers validation of the old password.
```
### Error Handling
```
✅ If the old password is incorrect, an error message appears as per the design.
✅ Ensure the user can re-enter the correct old password without refreshing the page.
✅ Validate that when the new password does not meet the criteria, an appropriate error message appears.
```
### Success Flow
```
✅ Check that after entering the correct old password and a valid new password, a success message is displayed.
✅ Confirm that after a successful password update, the user is redirected to the settings page.
✅ Verify that the new password is properly saved and can be used for login.
